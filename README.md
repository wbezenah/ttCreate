# **TableTop Create**

A comprehensive application developed to help people of all skill levels design and playtest board games!

_Currently in development..._

## Features
### Complete:
- resizing for global editor window
- titlebar with menus (no functionality assigned to submenus) and close/max/restore/min buttons

### In Progress:
- bug fixes!
- develop a JSON format for eventual saving/loading of projects
- design a flow for view swapping between editor modes (main: creator => sub: deck, card, etc./)

### TODO (unordered):
- models: card, deck, board
- components: wrappers for card, deck, board
- services: project service for saving, loading, component work synchronization, settings service for user preferences
- titlebar menu functionality... they look nice, but buttons should do something
- dynamic updating of current editor mode in creator-window component (fancy for: actually update editor view when changing view)

### TODO... but in a very very distant future and possibly never:
- in application playtesting... would be local, turn-based multiplayer... not online- im not THAT cool
- importing 3d models from blender
