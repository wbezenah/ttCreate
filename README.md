TableTop Create

A comprehensive application developed to help people of all skill levels design and playtest board games!

Currently in development...

In Progress:
- bug fixes!
- develop a JSON format for eventual saving/loading of projects
- design flow for view swapping between editor modes (main: creator => sub: deck, card, etc./)

Complete:
- resizing for global editor window
- titlebar with menus (no functionality assigned to submenus) and close/max/restore/min buttons

TODO (unordered):
- models: card, deck, board
- components: wrappers for card, deck, board
- services: project service for saving, loading, component work synchronization, settings service for user preferences
- titlebar menu functionality... they look nice, but buttons should do something
- dynamic updating of current editor mode in creator-window component (fancy for: actually update editor view when changing view)
